title: BiblioResources To-Be-Read
---

A working list of primarily academic resources of interest to the creator. This page has been created in the hopes that it may benefit anyone interested in dipping their toes into reading Jane Austen critical articles. 

It is by no means complete, nor entirely relevent on the surface. However, it could provide a starting point if you're interested in figuring out what academics work with Austen research; many of the academics do a wide range of formal and less-formal work for engaging a variety of people.

As a disclaimer, many of the resources on this list are sources the creator has yet to read in part or in full; if you do read any on the list please remember to make your own informed judgements on whether the reference is objective, well-researched, informative, etc, and not to assume that just because it shows up here, that it has been vetted. Although many of these resources are published by academic presses or through academic peer-reviewed journals, the creator has not done background research into those presses/journals.
